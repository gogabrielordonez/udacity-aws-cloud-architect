### Task 2: Calculate Infrastructure Costs

1.  Use the [AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/) to estimate how much it will cost to run the services in your Part 1 diagram for one month.
    
    -   Target a monthly estimate between $8,000-$10,000.
    -   Be mindful of AWS regions when you are estimating costs.
    -   Export the estimate as a CSV file named `Initial_Cost_Estimate.csv`.

Answer:
[Initial cost Estimate](Initial_Cost_Estimate.csv)



2.  Return to the [AWS Pricing Calculator](https://calculator.aws/#/) and reconfigure your estimates for the following scenarios:
    
    -   Your budget has been reduced from $8,000-$10,000 to a maximum of $6,500. What services will you modify to meet this new budget? Export the updated costs in a CSV file named `Reduced_Cost_Estimate.csv` and write up a brief narrative of the changes you made in the CSV file below the cost estimate.


Answer:
[Reduced cost Estimate](Reduced_Cost_Estimate.csv)

		
		
    -   Your budget has been increased to $20,000. What resources will you add and why?  
        Think about where to add redundancy and how to improve performance. Re-configure your estimate to a monthly invoice of $18K-20K. Export the updated costs to a CSV file named `Increased_Cost Estimate.csv` and write up a brief narrative of the changes you made in the CSV file below the cost estimate.
        
Answer:
[Increased cost Estimate](Increased_Cost_Estimate.csv
